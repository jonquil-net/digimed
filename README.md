##  **1. Assignment Outline**

 Create a suite of nine unified and responsive
 graphic icons in a flat design style,
 arranged on a simple HTML5 webpage.

 Each icon must provide some __*audiovisual
 feedback*__ in the form of an **image swap**,
 *and* a distinct, thematically appropriate
 **sound effect** when the user either hovers
 their mouse
 over, or clicks on, each icon.
 
  You must choose one of the following concepts
  to prompt the subject and aesthetics of your
  suite of icons:

 - Growth
 - Home
 - Movement
 - Climate
 - Community
 - Future
 - Empty
 - Legacy
 - Calm
 - **Memory**
 - System
 - Dream

 The webpage should contain no other elements
 aside from the icons and a background colour or
 image. There should be no text on or around the
 icons.

 You will be assessed on the unity of style in
 the overall suite of icons, your use of
 meaningful feedback in their interaction, and
 your use of the elements and principles of
 design.

## **2. Description**
### Overview 
 This is a simple HTML project that showcases a grid of nine responsive icons. These icons are based on the theme of "memory". 

 The icon illustrations are PNGs set up in a 3x3 flexbox grid with hover image effects and sound effects on click. 

 The project is created using a single HTML file that includes embedded CSS and JavaScript elements. 

**Features**

 The project includes the following features:

 * A grid of 9 icons created using HTML and embedded CSS
 * Each icon has a hover effect that is created using embedded CSS
 * Each icon has a sound effect that is played when the icon is clicked, which is created using embedded JavaScript
 ***

### Theme
 The theme that I've chosen for this is memory.

 I based my illustrations around childhood 
 memories I have from the early 2000s. A lot of
 these icons are based upon the futuristic designs
 of the time, now dubbed as "cyber y2k" 

 *(think blobjects, see-through game console and 
  computer casing, chrome coloured everything
  Microsoft's "Bliss" & low-poly 3D graphics)*
 
 We were instructed not to use 3D effects or 
 gradients so I've simulated some depth using 
 flat shading and lighting 

 We were asked to use a harmonious colour pallete
 so I decided upon mine by colour-picking from
 images of '00s toys, tech, advertisements etc. The colours used are a cool-toned pallete with splashes of magenta on a airy cream background.
